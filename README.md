# World-Happiness-Report - Prediction&Visualization
World Happiness is regularly published every year with the United Nations International Happiness Day. The World Happiness Report 2015 and 2016 rank 156 countries according to their happiness levels and this is important because finding happiness is affected by having a sense of purpose and feeling the value of everything that is done in life is worthwhile. 

With this work, I will try to identify which factors are more important in making people's lives happier. And I'll try finding factors that change happy rankings or scores between the reports of 2015 and 2016. At the same time, it should know which countries or regions have the highest overall happiness and each of the six factors contributing to happiness. This gives us the means to analyze all the people in the world and make them feel better. In conclusion, people and countries can focus on the more significant factors to reach a higher happiness level. I also will implement several machine learning algorithms to predict the happiness score and compare the result to discover which algorithm works better for this specific dataset.
